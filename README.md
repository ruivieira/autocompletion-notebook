# autocompletion-notebook

This notebook illustrates the usage of Naive Bayes and Decision Tree machine learning methods for classification. 

In order to run the notebook, you will need to install Jupyter with the IJava kernel. Instructions can be found at [https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava#installing](this link). 

In addition, you'll want to have maven [https://maven.apache.org/install.html](found here) installed and have the following repos cloned:

[https://github.com/ruivieira/java-naive-bayes](Java Naive Bayes)

[https://github.com/ruivieira/java-decision-tree](Java Decision Tree)

and built by calling `mvn clean install -Dskiptests` within each repo's base directory.
